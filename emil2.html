<h2 <p><i>I <i/> have played in the same organization my entire life before I came here to the University of Maine. The organization is located in my hometown and is called linkoping hockey club. When you are about to start 7th grade in school it's a couple of different tryouts and test to make the elite team who they called the School-team. At the first we were about 70 kids and they only had 28 spots at the team. So I maked this team and all of us Hockey player was in the same class for 3 years, and after these three years it was another tryout for the high school team were they had 10 spots and its was over 150 kids how wanted to be a part of the team. But I make that team too and started to play with the u18. I spend one year at the U18 team and played two years at the U20. Under these year I also represent the U18,U19 and U20 team Sweden in different national tournaments. Last season I also got the Award most goals overall U20.
